[ ![Codeship Status for daffl/mysam](https://codeship.com/projects/b26a3f10-3c66-0133-d19d-1276d5d0a1e7/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/102258)

Sam is an open-source, web-based "intelligent" assistant. It can listen to you, learn new actions and easily be extended with JavaScript plugins. Sam runs as an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) desktop application or in a modern browser.

# Installation

Install Sam globally via:

> npm install mysam -g

And then run either the desktop application with:

> mysam

Or the server (which is available at [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)) via:

> mysam --server

# Getting started

# Plugins

Plugins can be installed via [NPM](). To ask Sam about the weather run:

> npm install mysam-weather -g

Then restart the application.
